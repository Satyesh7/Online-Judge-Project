The project aims to develop a full-stack web application named Online Judge using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

This platform will allow users to solve coding problems by providing them with a code editor where they can write and submit their solutions. 

The system will automatically evaluate the submitted code and provide feedback, such as "Accepted," "Error," "Time Limit Exceeded," or other relevant information.
